Which strategy of investing is better prediction or buy/hold?
I took a look at 4 big companies to see what stratgey would work best. I looked at Amazon, Apple, Tesla, and Netlfix.
I used to different sets of data to run predictions to see if the information is accurate in which investing style is better.
I used the API Quandle and yahoo finance csv files for both companies.
I used to different methods of running the data. I used machine learning and deep learning to compare results. 
Using the models or root mean squares, linear regression, and LSTM.
The findings were conclusive that the buy/hold strategy would make an investor more money in the long term than the prediction model.
